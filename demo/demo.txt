Demo of watirmark framework
Going to automate twitter here, now in 5 minutes
Start with test cases
  Don't need framework to start, just need to know the feature
  Beauty is that this file is what we'll run to run our tests

watirmark twitter
  -  much like ruby on rails, creatse a scaffold of a new test project
run sample to make sure we're connected
copy over feature file

make fail (forget /i)
look at HTML output


run rake task (can I save to file without having to do that?)
