Demo of watirmark framework
Going to automate twitter here, now in 5 minutes
Start with test cases
  Don't need framework to start, just need to know the feature
  Beauty is that this file is what we'll run to run our tests

(1) Create a new project: watirmark twitter
  -  much like ruby on rails, create a scaffold of a new test project

(2) run sample to make sure we're connected
  - show test case
  - describe the feature we're going to test

(3) copy over feature file
  - run with failure

(4) get steps and create step definition file

This is where I need to glue the cucumber to the UI

(5) run to see things in pending

(6)
  edit query to add the
    - search
    - submit

(7) run to show query execute

(8) copy over code for the results

(9) run the results so we can see if pass

(10) show the actual HTML outputs for a success and failure
