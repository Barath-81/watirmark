Demo of watirmark framework
Going to automate twitter here, now in 5 minutes
Start with test cases
  No test automation in place but I know what the feature is supposed to do
  Don't need framework to start, just need to know the feature
  Beauty is that this file is what we'll run to run our tests

(1) Create a new project: watirmark twitter
  -  much like ruby on rails, create a scaffold of a new test project

(2) run sample to make sure we're connected
  - show test case



(3) copy over feature file
  - run with failure
  - All hat no cattle

(4) get steps and create step definition file


We have a query and a result but nothing yet defined to interact with the application

(5) generate code

This is where I need to glue the cucumber to the UI. How to do this? You guessed it - another code generator

(6)
  edit query to add the
    - search
    - submit

(7) run to show query execute

(8) copy over code for the results

(9) run the results so we can see if pass
